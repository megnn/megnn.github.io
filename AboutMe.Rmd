Name - Megan Riley
Age - 27 
Favorite Color - Green
Located - Foggy San Francisco

I am a current student in SMU's Masters of Data Science Program with an expected graduation date of Summer 2021. 
I grew up and lived in Arizona until I graduated from Arizona State University and Barrett the Honors College with a Bachelor's in Political Science and certificates in Civic Education and Technical Communication. 
I moved to the Bay Area with my now husband 2015 and spent four years as a Marketing Assistant for Pearson Education. 
I now spend most of my time staring at a screen absolutely wrecking my eyes or lurking mysteriously in fog.
